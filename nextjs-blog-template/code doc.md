# Code Documentation

I try to document everything about how I coded this blog-template here

## Styles

For styling this website, we are using tailwind framework. This framework is good because we dont have to write any `css`. All we do is to just write the classes in the `html tags`

## Components

In the `components` folder we create our `components` and what I mean by that is to create anything that is gonna be used everywhere such as the `header` component, the `footer` component, `layout` component, and so on

## Layout.js

This is the general code for every page in the website. We include this file for almost every page we create inisde the `page` folder

This file is where we put the stuf inside the `<head>` tag such as meta tags, `<title>` and so on

## Header.js

This is where we put the header stuff such as the navbar, menu and logo


## Pages

This is the folder where we put all the pages we need such as `index.js` and so on

## page/index.js

This is the homepage of the webiste. Anything we need to show on the homepage, we write it in this file

## blog folder

Here we put the files of any blog things related such as `blog.js` and so on
